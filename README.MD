Project: Making Sales Data Easy to Access for a Global Company

I'm working on a project for a big company that sells stuff all over the world. Right now, their sales information is scattered and hard to get to. We want to fix this by putting all the sales info in one spot so it's easier to use and make decisions with.

Here's what I'm doing step by step:

Step 1: Getting Ready

I'm using a tool called GitHub to keep track of my work and share it online.
Step 2: Gathering and Cleaning Up Data

I started by setting up a new place to keep our data, called a database, on my computer using something called pgadmin4.
I wrote three pieces of code to help me gather data from different places like spreadsheets, online services, and Amazon's storage service. These pieces of code help me grab, clean up, and store the data.
I made sure to clean up the data, like fixing dates and removing bad info, before putting it in our database.
I got information about our stores from an online service, details about what we sell from spreadsheets stored online, and sales information from a special format file. I cleaned all this info and added it to our database.
Step 3: Organizing the Database

I made sure our database was set up correctly, with all the pieces of information in the right spots and connected the right way.
Step 4: Using the Data

Finally, I started using the database to answer important questions about our sales, like how many stores we have, which products sell the most, and how our online sales are doing.
This project is all about making it easier for our company to look at our sales data and make smart decisions.
